# Building a Todo List Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery üìì‚úçÔ∏è

### Introduction
In this project, we'll create a dynamic Todo list using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. A Todo list is a fundamental tool for organizing tasks, and building one from scratch can provide valuable insights into web development concepts and practices.

### HTML Structure
We'll start by structuring the Todo list using HTML. Each task will be represented by an `<li>` element within an `<ul>` list. We'll also include input fields for adding new tasks and buttons for marking tasks as complete or deleting them.

### Styling with CSS
CSS will be used to enhance the visual appeal and usability of our Todo list. We'll apply styles to differentiate between completed and pending tasks, as well as add animations for a more interactive experience.

### JavaScript Functionality
The core functionality of our Todo list will be implemented using JavaScript. We'll handle tasks such as adding new tasks, marking tasks as complete, and deleting tasks dynamically. JavaScript will enable us to manipulate the DOM based on user interactions, making our Todo list responsive and intuitive.

### jQuery Integration
jQuery will complement our JavaScript code by simplifying DOM manipulation and event handling. With jQuery, we can achieve the same functionality with less code, enhancing readability and maintainability.

### Todo List Functionalities
1. **Adding Tasks**: Users can input new tasks using a text field and add them to the list.
2. **Marking Tasks as Complete**: Clicking on a task will toggle its completion status, visually distinguishing between completed and pending tasks.
3. **Deleting Tasks**: Users can remove tasks from the list by clicking on a delete button associated with each task.

By combining HTML for structure, CSS for styling, JavaScript for functionality, and jQuery for DOM manipulation, we'll create a robust and user-friendly Todo list application suitable for personal or professional use.
