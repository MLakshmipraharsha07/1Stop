# Building a Calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 

#### Introduction
In this project, we'll walk through the process of building a calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This calculator will be capable of performing basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user interface will be designed using HTML and styled with CSS for a visually appealing appearance.

#### HTML Structure
The HTML structure of our calculator consists of various elements such as buttons for numbers, operators, and a display screen to show the input and output. Each button will have an associated JavaScript function to handle user interactions.

#### CSS Styling
To enhance the visual appeal of our calculator, we'll apply CSS styles to elements such as buttons, display screen, and overall layout. Styling will include colors, fonts, borders, and positioning to create a modern and user-friendly interface.

#### JavaScript Functionality
The core functionality of our calculator will be implemented using JavaScript. We'll write functions to handle user inputs, perform arithmetic operations, and update the display screen accordingly. Additionally, error handling will be implemented to ensure smooth user experience.

#### Features
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Clear and All Clear Functionality:** Clear the last input or clear all inputs.
- **Decimal Support:** Ability to input decimal numbers for precise calculations.
- **Keyboard Support:** Users can input numbers and operators using their keyboard for convenience.

#### Conclusion
By combining HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality, we'll create a fully functional calculator that can be easily integrated into any web application. This project demonstrates the power of front-end technologies in building interactive and dynamic user interfaces.
